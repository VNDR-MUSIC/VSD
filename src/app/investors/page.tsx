                    <p>Investing in early-stage technology projects, especially those involving cryptocurrencies, AI, and Web3, carries a high degree of risk. Before making any decision to invest VSD tokens in the AUDIO EXCHANGE project, you must carefully consider the following non-exhaustive list of risks:</p>
                    <ul className="list-disc pl-5">
                        <li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> The value of VSD tokens, AEX tokens (if and when issued), and the overall cryptocurrency market can be extremely volatile. You may lose a significant portion or all of your invested capital.</li>
                        <li><strong>Project Development Risk:</strong> AUDIO EXCHANGE is a conceptual project currently under planning and development. There is no guarantee that the project will be successfully developed, launched, or achieve its stated objectives. Delays, changes in scope, or failure to deliver are possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Technological Risks:</strong> The project relies on complex technologies, including AI and blockchain. There may be unforeseen technical challenges, bugs, or vulnerabilities in the software, smart contracts, or AI models.</li>
                        <li><strong>Regulatory Uncertainty:</strong> The regulatory landscape for digital assets, token offerings, and AI is rapidly evolving and varies significantly by jurisdiction. Future laws or regulations could adversely impact the AUDIO EXCHANGE project, VSD tokens, or AEX tokens.</li>
                        <li><strong>No Guarantee of Returns:</strong> There is no promise or guarantee of any financial return, profit, or appreciation in value from investing VSD in AUDIO EXCHANGE or from holding AEX tokens. The success of AUDIO EXCHANGE and any associated tokens depends on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control.</li>
                        <li><strong>Liquidity Risk:</strong> There is no guarantee that AEX tokens will be listed on any exchange or that a liquid market for them will develop. You may not be able to sell or trade your AEX tokens easily or at your desired price.</li>
                        <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Despite efforts to implement security measures, decentralized platforms and smart contracts can be targets for hackers and malicious actors. Loss of funds due to security breaches is possible.</li>
                        <li><strong>Dependence on VSD Network:</strong> The success of AUDIO EXCHANGE may be partially dependent on the continued development, success, and stability of the VSD Network.</li>
